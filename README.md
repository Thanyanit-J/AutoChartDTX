# AutoChartDTX

This project aims to automatically convert any song to a chart for a drum rhythm game called [DTXMania](https://osdn.net/projects/dtxmania/).

To test stuff, we have set up [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Thanyanit-J/AutoChartDTX/blob/main/AutoChart.ipynb)

Use the Colab notebook to upload a song and download zipped Simfiles. Extract the zipped folder to the game folder, then you can play the chart.


Download [DTXMania](https://osdn.net/projects/dtxmania/downloads/76181/DTXMania119%28211020%29_DTXC035%28191001%29.zip/) or visit the [website](https://osdn.net/projects/dtxmania/)
